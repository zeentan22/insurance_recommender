<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A person decision to purchase an insurance product is contingent on his preference and demographics. For example, a person that is below the entry age will not be able to purchase certain insurance product. However, using demographics to predict the insurance policy only can be difficult especially with the lack of data. In this project, insurance products are filtered based on a customer demographics. Grey Relation Analysis is then applied on the remaining insurance products to recommend  the policy that offers the most utility to the customer.
